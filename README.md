Philosophy Developed under the doctrine of "Stay Hard." This plugin was engineered to solve 10-year-old engine limitations (like Maid Swapping) through sheer brute force and discipline.
It allows you to swap maids during harem yotogi for skills that are not supposed to swapped, the maids are treated as their own personality and say their own voicelines related to the skills.

## Features

### 1. Scene & Lighting Control
*   **Lighting**: Adjust main light intensity, shadow strength, and light color (RGB) in real-time.
*   **Post Processing**: Control Bloom intensity, Saturation, and Color Grading (Red/Green/Blue channels).
*   **Animation**: Adjust animation playback speed and sync it across characters.

### 2. Multi-Screens
*   Display up to 3 sub-camera windows per maid focused on specific body parts: **Face**, **Chest**, and **Pelvis**.
*   Customize FOV, distance, and rotation for each sub-camera.
*   **Profiles**: Save and load your camera configurations.

### 3. Face Control
*   Quickly apply a wide variety of facial expressions categorized by type (Common, Erotic, Action, etc.).
*   Support for face blending (Cheeks, Tears, Drool).

### 4. Prop TV
*   **Spawn TV**: Spawns the in-game monitor prop (`Odogu_ShinShitsumu_Monitor`).
*   **Transform**: Move and rotate the TV freely using sliders or text input.
*   **Video Playback**: Load and play video files from your computer directly onto the TV prop. You can use .ine files for COM3D2
*   **Profiles**: Save and load TV positions and video paths.

### 5. Kiss & Body Reactions
*   **Auto Kiss**: Automatically triggers kiss animations when the camera (or VR headset) gets close to the maid.
*   **Drool Effect**: Adds dynamic drool during kiss or oral service actions.
*   **Body Reactions**: Dynamic sweat, nipple erection, clitoris erection, and blushing based on the maid's excitement level.

### 6. Maid Swap & LookAt
*   **Swap**: Swap the main maid with any other maid in the scene, transferring state and position. You have to select the same yotogi position again or another position.
*   **LookAt**: Force the maid to look at specific targets: Main Camera, Sub-screens, Master, or other Maids.

### 7. Video Player (Overlay)
*   A standalone video player window that overlays the game, independent of the 3D scene props.

## Requirements

### Sweat Effects
For the **Sweat Effects** in the "Misc" / "Body Reaction" tab to work correctly, you **must** download and install the specific sweat texture mod.

*   **Download Link**: [https://uu.getuploader.com/cm3d2_g/download/229](https://uu.getuploader.com/cm3d2_g/download/229)

Without this file, the sweat sliders/automation may not be visible or functional on the maid's body.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have **BepInEx** installed for COM3D2.
2.  Place the `COM3D2.SFH.YotogiCAM.Plugin` (or compiled plugin file) into your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.
3.  (Optional) Install the sweat textures mentioned above into your game's `Mod` folder. Equip the sweat props to your maids.

## Usage

*   Press **F6** to toggle the main UI window.
